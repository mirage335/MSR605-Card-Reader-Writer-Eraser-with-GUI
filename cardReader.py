    Description: This is an interface that allows manipulation of the MSR605 magnetic
                 stripe card reader/writer.
    

                There is a programming manual for the MSR605:
                    https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9M7JgYQ-UQdT2ZUMk9aUDBNUnc/edit
                    
                I also got some understanding of how to use it with python from these sites:                
                    https://www.triades.net/msr605-driver.html
                    https://github.com/pezmanlou/msr605
                    
                
                I don't use Python much, so if there are any coding style problems that don't
                conform to the PEP 8 standard feel free to email me
                
                This class imports serial which is pySerial module, more info on it here:
                    http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/index.html
                    
                It also imports time, just incase you want to include delays, I had some but I
                took them out
                
                It also imports isoStandardDictionary which follows an ISO standard (described
                here:  http://www.abacus21.com/magnetic-strip-encoding-1586.html) for how to
                encode the 3 tracks on the magnetic stripe card (magstripe)
                
                
                The programming manual mostly has info in Hex (Base 16) and Decimal (Base 10)
                but also has some info in Binary (Base 2). If you're confused about it I provide
                some comments on both hex and decimal implementations. I recommned looking at an
                ASCII table if you're confused
